## üîç **Description**

1. **Data Cleaning and Deduplication**  
   - Addressed data inconsistencies to ensure accuracy and reliability.
   - Differentiated movies with identical titles by tagging them as "old" or "new" based on production date.

2. **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**  
   - Utilized DAX in Power BI to create custom measures, such as:
     - Calculating return on investment (ROI) for each movie.
     - Identifying top directors by ratings and ROI.
     - Highlighting critically acclaimed and most successful movies for each director.

3. **Dashboard Development**  
   - Built an interactive dashboard to visualize:
     - Trends in average movie runtime over the years.
     - Popular genres and their growth over time.
     - Correlations between approval index and ROI, showing the financial and critical success of different genres and directors.
